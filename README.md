# Java Chatting Application

The Java Chatting Application is a desktop application developed using Java Swing, AWT, and Socket programming. It enables users to chat with each other over a network, allowing real-time communication between multiple clients and a server.

## Features

- **Real-Time Chatting**: Users can send and receive messages instantly, enabling real-time communication.
- **Server-Client Architecture**: The application follows a client-server architecture, where one client can communicate with multiple clients through a central server.
- **Simple User Interface**: The user interface is designed using Java Swing and AWT, providing a simple and intuitive experience for users.
- **Socket Programming**: Socket programming is used to establish communication channels between the server and clients, enabling message exchange over the network.

## Technologies Used

- **Java Swing & AWT**: Used for frontend development to create the user interface for both the server and client applications.
- **Socket Programming**: Used to establish communication channels between the server and clients over a network.
- **Core Java**: Used for backend development to implement the application logic and handle message exchange between clients and the server.
